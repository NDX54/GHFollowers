    /* ABOUT CLOSURES
     
     Closures are either escaping or non-escaping; @escaping closures can outlive their respective functions.
     Closures are used for asynchronous stuff; they are called in a background thread.
     By default, closures are non-escaping; it doesn't outlive the function.
     
     Our closure can be called after a period of time. In the example of having a bad internet connection, loading the followers can take a while.
     This is why we need our closures to be escaping â€“ we need it to live longer than the function.
     When a closure escapes, we have to do something about it.
